# Binary trees and Splay trees

This project in my Algorithms class implements a binary search tree and its variant a splay tree.
It shows the timing differential between a binary search tree and a splay tree.
The project is easy to compile and run granted a C++ compiler is already installed.

To compile the project:

```
g++ main.cpp -o main
```

To run the project

```
./main
```
